for changing the path and later all the admin-panel redirects 
change the path of every admin-panel to (whatever name used for the panel in the website ) to fix the navigation across the implemented admin panel


now maybe the rule changes but, when we want to implement the panel, here we can do something else to register the correct path of the host 

/admin-panel/includes

or

/main_folder_name/admin-panel/includes

then replace it by 

/main_folder_name/name_of_the_panel/includes


after this work is done then we will move to the next part where we will change all the  base directory name path/url to the new one 

old one can be like this 

[ /admin-panel  ]

now in the function file also replace it with the following 

[ /main_folder_name/name_of_the_panel ] for example; /dps/cpntrol-dashboard


maybe wont work, check by removing the "/" before main folder name in function file as shown avove .



** for working on local only, 

now switchback to [ /name_of_the_panel ] the only path when you upload it to the online hosting service provider

for gallery image, it uploads under, 'uploads/materials/gallery'
